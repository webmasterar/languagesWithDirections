This repository contains a list of officially recognised languages as per
ISO-639-2 in addition to the current direction it is written in in its most
popular or modern script.

The column headers of the CSV file are: alpha3, altAlpha3, alpha2, enLabel, frLabel,
direction. The directions are LTR (left-to-right), RTL (right-to-left) or TTB
(top-to-bottom left-to-right).

The original list was obtained from here: http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/ISO-639-2_8859-1.txt

I can't guarantee it is an accurate or complete list but if you do notice a
mistake or something missing, please make a pull request. Thanks.
